        <p>Hi there! I'm Joel Cisneros, an aspiring software engineer/full stack
        web developer. I was born and raised in Orange County, CA and I am currently
        18 years old embarking on my software developer journey. I graduated from
        Tarbut V' Torah Community Day School for highschool and decided self-study and
        a coding bootcamp was a more suitable option than traditional junior university for
        what I wish to do. I have been a tech 'geek' and very savvy with technologies most of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on in my childhood I was introduced to video games, mobile technologies (apps, games, etc),
        and PC's. I was hooked the moment I started and always had a knack for solving whatever issue my
        technologies would provide. During highschool I dabbled in a little bit of code, attempting to
        make my own primitve video games to enjoy during lunchtime. However, I didn't fully delve into coding
        until the end of my senior year. At that point, I had been taught to think very logically by my parents
        and had natural problem-solving intuition.
        </p>
        <p>I started my coding journey by taking Harvard's online CS50 class through their youtube videos.
        David Malan is an outstanding professor who taught me C++, several theoretical computer science topics, and more.
        After that, I decided to fully commit to becoming a software engineer and learned my first two languages (disregarding C++):
        HTML and CSS. Now I am enrolled in Learning Fuze's prep course and am learning JavaScript on the side to hopefully
        take their full immersion course so that I can achieve the higher level of education that I am looking for to achieve my dreams!
